### Video Walkthrough 
Watch Charlie go through his first HAB launch and debugging tips and tricks [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDZch9NWOLA&list=PLhmx0ZGiO2sNXqH09_9cT4NBlGAUTOnFS&index=9).

### Software debugging tips <!-- omit from toc -->
- Observe bug, what is the signs or symptoms of the bug.
- â€‹**Isolate.** Separate code into sections and verify each section works as intended.
- Create test case, smallest test case which replicates the bug.
- Inspect and analyse the bug to find solution.

### Common things to remember <!-- omit from toc -->
- Data types, check no data type conflicts or integer overflow is occurring.
- Use print statements to check program states.
- Log debugging test cases and results.
- Check hardware.
