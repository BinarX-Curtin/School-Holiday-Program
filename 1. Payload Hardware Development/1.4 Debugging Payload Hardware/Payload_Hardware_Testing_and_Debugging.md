## Objectives
1. Identify problems within the flight software code.
2. Systematically debug the identified problems.

## Requirements
1. STM32CubeIDE installed on device
1. Pen and paper
1. STM32L432KC Microcontroller with usb a to micro usb cable

## Procedure

### Software debugging tips <!-- omit from toc -->
- Observe bug, what is the signs or symptoms of the bug.
- â€‹**Isolate.** Separate code into sections and verify each section works as intended.
- Create test case, smallest test case which replicates the bug.
- Inspect and analyse the bug to find solution.

### Common things to remember <!-- omit from toc -->
- Data types, check no data type conflicts or integer overflow is occurring.
- Use print statements to check program states.
- Log debugging test cases and results.
- Check hardware.
