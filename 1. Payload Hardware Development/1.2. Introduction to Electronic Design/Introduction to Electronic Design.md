## Objectives
1. Familiarise ourselves with the funadmentals of electrical circuits.
2. Familiarise ourselves with how to wire up basic digital ICs (integrated circuits) including decoupling capacitors.
4. Build a basic circuit to turn an LED on and off.
5. Wire up a temperature sensor for future use with the microcontroller.
6. Use a multimeter to measure voltages in our circuits.

## Requirements
1. STM32CubeIDE installed on device
2. Pen and paper
3. STM32L432KC Microcontroller with usb a to micro usb cable
