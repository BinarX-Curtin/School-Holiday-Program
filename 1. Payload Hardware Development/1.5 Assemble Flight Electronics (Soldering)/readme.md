## Objectives
1. Learn how to solder safely.
2. Solder headers to protoboard.
3. Solder components and wires to finalise protoboard for software testing.

## Requirements
1. Protoboard and components (including headers). (Or if using this tutorial to solder headers onto Arduino Micros, you'll need the Arduino Micros (without headers) and header pins.
1. Pen and paper
1. Soldering station.

- BinarX youtube walkthrough with Athena - [Guide to soldering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w1aexhTjbs&list=PLhmx0ZGiO2sNXqH09_9cT4NBlGAUTOnFS)
- PowerPoint Presentation - [How to Solder](https://github.com/BinarX-Curtin/School-Holiday-Program/blob/main/1.%20Payload%20Hardware%20Development/1.5%20Assemble%20Flight%20Electronics%20(Soldering)/Soldering%20Summary.pptx)

## Procedure

### 1.0 Watch Athena's guide to soldering and follow along on the PowerPoint Presentation
- [Guide to soldering YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w1aexhTjbs&list=PLhmx0ZGiO2sNXqH09_9cT4NBlGAUTOnFS)
- [How to Solder PPT Presentation](https://github.com/BinarX-Curtin/School-Holiday-Program/blob/main/1.%20Payload%20Hardware%20Development/1.5%20Assemble%20Flight%20Electronics%20(Soldering)/Soldering%20Summary.pptx)
- If necessary, cut off any excess header pins
- Place header pins into holes on protoboard or Arduino Micro, depending on what you're using
- Solder header pins into protoboard or Arduino Micro
- Referring back to Athena's PowerPoint, check to see if you have any bad solder joints or bridges
