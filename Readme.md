# BinarX Summer 2024 School Holiday Program

## Program Objectives
1. Build a basic electronics sensor payload.
2. Develop microcontroller software to run your sensor and save the data for later processing.
3. Design and manufacture a custom payload section to hold your payload.
4. Build and decorate a model rocket to fly your payload.
5. Launch your rocket and collect data during the flight! ðŸš€
6. Process the data and present the results from your flight on a poster.
7. Optional: Design and create a custom rocket team t-shirt!

## Program Preparation

### Each Day:
- Make sure you wear enclosed shoes, otherwise you won't be able to participate as you won't be permitted to enter the laboratory.(No thongs or open toed shoes or sandals).
- Bring your lunch from home. There is no microwave or fridge available.
- Bring a hat, sunscreen and water bottle with a lid that seals.
- Bring a USB flash drive.
- Bring a Microsoft Windows or Mac based laptop if you can. (this is optional as lab computers will be made available at Curtin for participants)
- Bring a set of headphones.
- Bring some pen and paper (or a tablet & stylus).

### Before the First Day:
- Create an Autodesk account and sign up for a Fusion360 education use license: https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal. (if you can't get a education use license, a personal license is applicable)
- Sign up for a my.st.com account: https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/user-registration.html.
- Install Fusion 360 (https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal) on your Windows or Mac based laptop, if you're bringing one.
- Install STM32CubeIDE on your Windows, Mac or Linux based laptop, if you're bringing one (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html).
- Install Inkscape on your Windows or Mac based laptop, if you're bringing one (https://inkscape.org/en/release/)
- If you would like to, and with parental or carer consent, sign up for a Discord account to communicate online with the other participants and the program facilitators: https://discord.com/.
- Purchase a black 100% cotton t-shirt in your size, pre-wash and dry it, and bring it to the program. Please write your name on the tag.

### Parental or Carer Permission
In order to participate in the program you must return the permission form to Curtin consenting to:
- Create an Autodesk account to use Fusion 360.
- Create a my.st.com account to use STM32CubeIDE.
- Create an inkscape.com account to use Inkscape.
- The use of your image and voice in photography and videography in communications relating to the program by:
    - Curtin University,
    - The WA Department of Education,
    - WA Schools Involved in the BinarX Program, and
    - The WA Department of Jobs, Tourism, Science and Innovation.
- Both the participants and parents or carers being contacted with communications from Curtin University related to the program.
- Bus the students to the launch site in the Perth area in the event that the launch is not at Curtin.
