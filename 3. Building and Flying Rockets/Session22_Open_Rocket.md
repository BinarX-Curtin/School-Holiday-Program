# Payload Section Design in 3D CAD <!-- omit from toc -->

## NOTES
Kyle said the height of the rocket with camera was modelled to 240ish feet approximately 80m. MD for that session with only the order of operations. Would be good to use CLIPCAM to record the rest of that session with Kyle showing on the screen in a hands on demo (Mic'd up with just screen or with webcam).

## Objectives
1. Add the measured dimensions of the rocket to OpenRocket
2. Model the trajectory of the rocket using OpenRocket

## Requirements
1. OpenRocket installed on device

## Resources

## Procedure

## 1.0 Open Rocket Sequence of Operations

Kyle needs to give me a hand with order but I think it is currently
1. nosecone
2. body
3. fins?
4. payload
5. engine?
